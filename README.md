Java Programming – From Basics to Advanced 🚀
📢 Introduction
Welcome to my Java Programming Repository! 🎯
This repository is dedicated to learning Java programming from scratch and gradually moving towards advanced topics. Whether you are a beginner just starting with Java or an experienced programmer looking to brush up on advanced concepts, this repo provides a structured learning path with code examples, explanations, and real-world projects.

📂 Repository Structure
This repository is divided into different sections, covering various aspects of Java programming. Each section contains well-commented code and explanations.

1️⃣ Java Fundamentals 🏗️
In this section, you will find the basics of Java, which are essential for beginners:

✅ Introduction to Java – Setting up Java (JDK & IDEs), first Java program

✅ Variables and Data Types – Primitive and non-primitive types

✅ Operators in Java – Arithmetic, Logical, Relational, Bitwise, Assignment operators

✅ Control Statements – if-else, switch-case, loops (for, while, do-while)

✅ Functions/Methods in Java – Function declaration, return types, recursion

2️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java 🏛️
The core of Java is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and this section covers:

📌 Classes & Objects – How to create and use them

📌 Constructors – Default, parameterized, and copy constructors

📌 Encapsulation – Data hiding and access modifiers

📌 Inheritance – Single, multilevel, hierarchical, and multiple inheritance using interfaces

📌 Polymorphism – Method overloading and method overriding

📌 Abstraction – Abstract classes and interfaces

3️⃣ Exception Handling & File Handling 📂
⚡ Try, Catch, Finally, Throws, and Throw – Handling runtime errors

⚡ Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions – Understanding types of exceptions

⚡ File Handling – Reading & writing files using FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and Scanner

4️⃣ Intermediate Java Concepts 🚀
Once you have mastered the basics, you can move on to:

🔹 Collections Framework – Lists, Sets, Maps, Stacks, Queues

🔹 Multi-threading in Java – Thread, Runnable, synchronization, inter-thread communication

🔹 Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) – Connecting Java with MySQL/PostgreSQL

5️⃣ Advanced Java Topics ⚙️
For those looking to master Java, this section contains:

🔥 Java 8+ Features – Lambda expressions, Stream API, Functional interfaces

🔥 Networking in Java – Sockets, HTTP requests, and web communication

🔥 Design Patterns in Java – Singleton, Factory, Observer, and other common patterns

6️⃣ Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in Java 🧮
This section focuses on implementing data structures and algorithms in Java:

📌 Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues

📌 Trees (Binary Tree, BST, AVL, etc.)

📌 Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall)

📌 Sorting & Searching Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, etc.)
